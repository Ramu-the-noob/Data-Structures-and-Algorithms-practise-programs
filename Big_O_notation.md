big O notation

O(1) = constant time, independent of input size
eg : accesing element of array, inserting in the beginning of a linkedlist

O(log n) = logarithmic time, gets more efficient as size of dataset increases
eg: binary search

O(n) = linear time , depends on input size
eg: iterating through elements in an array, searching through a linkedlist

O(n log n) = quasilinear time, slower than linear time at large input values
eg: quicksort, mergesort

O(n^2) = quadratic time, increases exponentially depending on input size
eg: insertion sort, bubblesort

O(n!) = factorial time, worst time comlexity possible
eg : traveling salesman problem
